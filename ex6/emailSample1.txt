Important Information – Food and Drink Ban

In response to student concerns and in support of academic integrity initiatives, students are now prohibited from consuming food and drinks (with the exception of water in a clear bottle with no label) during their final examinations. Students can, however, make arrangements for a short nutrition break with a Proctor outside the exam venue during the final exam.
If a single short break will not be sufficient because a student is medically required to consume food or drinks regularly during a final exam, the student must register for special accommodations with AccessAbility Services and must submit appropriate documentation from a recognized professional at least three weeks prior to the start of the final examination period.
